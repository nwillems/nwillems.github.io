This is my small blog. Welcome - maybe nothings gonna happen.

But right now I'm learning eleventy as a static site generator.

Maybe, instead of an actual blog, with updates etc, this is more of a knowledge base(thats a big
word) for me. So instead of new technologies, maybe there be a post with links to things, and a post
about the setup of servers.

Originally when I transitioned to this [monospaced](https://owickstrom.github.io/the-monospace-web/)
layout, i just enviosioned a bunch of pages, no indexing or links really. But elevnty has made it
fairly simple. so maybe :shrug:
